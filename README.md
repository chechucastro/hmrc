### NOTES for the tester
> ```Test was done thinking as a mobile first solution```
> ```Handmade grid layout system without Bootstrap or any other frameworks```
> ```I realized that "Maxlength" does not work with inputs with "type=number" property so a bit of JS in order to block to 15 chars max```
> ```Sorry I didn't have more time to create a few JavaScript validators```
> ```Sorry about the jpg quality, I sliced it from a PDF file with low quality```
> ```I took the freedom to add a Google font to go quicker. Obviously I could be done better with @font-face```
